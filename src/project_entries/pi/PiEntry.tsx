        I made this program after me teacher told me about this as I thought it
        was very strange that pi showed up in a physics simulation. This is a
        very inefficient way to calculate pi, but I wrote it in C++ to make it
        as fast as possible. I found that{" "}

        gives an excellent explanation of the phenomenon.

        This was mostly a maths problem as I needed to rearrange the equations
        for elastic collisions to give me the output I wanted.
