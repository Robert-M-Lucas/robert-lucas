        I made this program after me teacher told me about this as I thought it was very strange that pi showed up in a physics simulation. This is a very inefficient way to calculate pi,
        but I wrote it in C++ to make it as fast as possible. I found that <ProjLink href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsYwFizhncE">this
        YouTube video</ProjLink> gives an excellent explanation of the phenomenon.

        This was mostly a maths problem as I needed to rearrange the equations for elastic collisions to give me the output I wanted.
